        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Momo is a steamed dumpling popular in Nepal, typically filled with minced meat or vegetables mixed with onions, garlic, ginger, and spices. The dough is made from all-purpose flour and water, rolled into thin circles, stuffed with the seasoned filling, and folded into small dumplings. They are steamed until soft and served hot with a spicy tomato-based dipping sauce called achar.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup water (as needed for dough)</li>
            <li>250g minced chicken, pork, or vegetables</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Oil for greasing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour and water to form a smooth dough, then cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the filling by combining minced meat or vegetables with onion, garlic, ginger, coriander, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into thin circles about 3 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle.</li>
            <li>Fold and pinch the edges to seal the dumpling into your desired momo shape.</li>
            <li>Grease a steamer tray lightly with oil and arrange the momos so they don’t stick together.</li>
            <li>Steam for 10–12 minutes, or until the dough is cooked and the filling is hot.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with spicy tomato achar.</li>
        </ol>
